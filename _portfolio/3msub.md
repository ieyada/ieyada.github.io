As a big fan of watching movies in their original language, I've spent an enormous amount of time fighting with subtitles, finding the correct one and getting the synchronization *just* right. When I learnt programming, it seemed like I could do my present- and future self a favour and save myself some time. [This script](https://github.com/anebz/progex/tree/master/Adjust%20subtitles%20script) adjusts the subtitle position in time, adjusting the timing (delay or rush) by the number of seconds specified.
