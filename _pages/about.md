Welcome to my website!


I am an assistant professor in the Finance department at [King Saud University](https://ksu.edu.sa/en/) in Saudi Arabia. My main research interests are in corporate finance, primarily on debt maturity structures, and textual analysis of financial disclosures. I also worked on corporate payout policy and asset pricing.


I received my PhD from [The University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu) - [Darla Moore School of Business](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/index.php). I am also an ISU alumni; I received my MBA from the [Scott College of Business at Indiana State University](https://www.indstate.edu/business/).


Free time interests include Python coding, traveling & camping, and playing pool "Billiards"
