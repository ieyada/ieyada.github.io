Welcome to my website!

My name is Eyad, and I am an assistant professor of Finance at [*King Saud University*](https://ksu.edu.sa/en/) in Saudi Arabia. My research interests are mainly in the field of Corporate Finance; primarily on Debt Maturity Structures & Textual Analysis of Financial Disclosures and their implications in corporate finance. I also worked on corporate payout policy as well as asset pricing.
