I am Eyad, an Assistant Professor of Finance at the College of Business Administration at [*King Saud University*](https://ksu.edu.sa/en/){:target="_blank"}. Alongside my academic role, I serve as a Research Advisor to the [Saudi Capital Market Authority (CMA)](https://cma.org.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx){:target="_blank"}, where I contribute to initiatives that enhance evidence-based financial policy and regulation.

My research is in empirical corporate finance, with an emphasis on the strategic decisions that shape firm behavior and value. My earlier work investigated the effect of firm's growth opportunities on their debt maturity structure choice. My broader research interests include governance, capital structure choices, and payout policy.

I received my Ph.D. in Finance from the [Darla Moore School of Business](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/index.php){:target="_blank"} at the [*University of South Carolina*](https://sc.edu){:target="_blank"} and my MBA from the Scott College of Business at [*Indiana State University*](https://www.indstate.edu/business/){:target="_blank"}.

In the classroom, I adopt an application-driven approach. While teaching courses, such as Portfolio Theory & Investment Analysis, I emphasize the integration of theory with real-world practice. To this end, I incorporate tools such as [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} and Excel to provide students with hands-on techniques for analyzing financial data, constructing portfolios, and evaluating performance. My goal is to equip students with both the conceptual knowledge and the practical analytical skills necessary for a successful career in finance.
