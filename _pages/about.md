I am Eyad, an Assistant Professor of Finance at [King Saud University](https://ksu.edu.sa/en/){:target="_blank"}. Alongside my academic role, I serve as a Research Advisor at the [Saudi Capital Market Authority (CMA)](https://cma.org.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx){:target="_blank"}, where I contribute to initiatives that improve the functioning and integrity of capital markets in the Kingdom.

My primary research is in corporate finance, with an emphasis on managerial decisions that shape firm behavior and value. My earlier work examines the effect of growth opportunities on firm's debt maturity structure choice. My broader research interests on the other hand include governance, capital structure choice, and payout policy.

In addition to research, I teach both undergraduate and graduate level courses at [KSU](https://ksu.edu.sa/en/){:target="_blank"}. My style of teaching tends to be an  *application-driven* approach. For example, I incorporate tools such as [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} and Excel in courses, such as Investment Analysis, to demonstrate how one can use such tools for analyzing financial data, constructing portfolios, and evaluating investment performance. My goal is to equip students with both the conceptual knowledge and the practical analytical skills necessary for a successful career in finance.

I received my Ph.D. from the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu){:target="_blank"}-[Darla Moore School of Business](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/){:target="_blank"} and my MBA from the [Indiana State University](https://www.indstate.edu/business/){:target="_blank"}-[Scott College of Business](https://indianastate.edu/academics/colleges/business){:target="_blank"}.
