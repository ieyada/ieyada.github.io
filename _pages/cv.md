Education
------

* **MSc. in Computational linguistics** \| 2018-2020 \| LMU, Germany
  * Project to determine the semantic similarity between two documents from an input of 1.3k docs on a corpus of 58k words. Generation of semantic features of all docs in 32s, comparison of documents in 5s.
  * Implementation of an (in-)sincere question classifier with pre-trained embeddings on a BiLSTM model with Attention on a 1.3M question input with 94%-6% imbalance. F1-score of 0.66. ([~/kaggle](https://github.com/anebz/kaggle))
  * Semester-long group project on transport recommendation given an origin and destination coordinate points. Development of geodata preprocessing and ensemble models yielding an F1-score of 0.68. ([~/kdd-cup-2019](https://github.com/AlessandroVol23/kdd-cup-2019))
  * Exploration of semantic similarities between contextualized embeddings in English and Basque. ([~/eu-sim](https://github.com/anebz/eu-sim))
  * **Master thesis**: the effects of word segmentation quality on word alignments. ([thesis](https://github.com/anebz/thesis))

* **BSc. in Telecommunication Systems Engineering** \| 2013-2017 \| Tecnun - Universidad de Navarra, Spain
  * Project to determine the highest-scoring combination of letters in a Boggle board that yields a given hash. An error of one letter is allowed and the algorithm runs in under 0.1s. ([~/boggle](https://github.com/julencestero/boggle))
  * Bachelor thesis: implementation of a traceability processing algorithm with high recursivity in 8MB input csv files producing ~900MB files. Programmed in Scala to use RDDs and run in an AWS EMR.
