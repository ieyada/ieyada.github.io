Welcome to Episode 3 of our Python series. Building on our previous discussions, this lesson shows how to construct an *optimal portfolio* by applying the Markowitz optimization procedure. We'll explore how to identify the portfolio that offers the highest expected return for a given level of risk (The highest Sharpe ratio), or the minimum risk for a given level of expected return. Be sure to skim through episodes 1 & 2 before following along.
