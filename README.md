### Enhancements
I found this [issue](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137) in the [*academicpages*](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) repository about a change in the skin. Being the dark-mode lover that I am, I eagerly tried it, but it seems the format is \*slightly\* changed. I went to light mode for now and I'll continue to use the *Dark Reader* extension until something more stable is available.
