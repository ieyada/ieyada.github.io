Using a sample of all public firms in the U.S. between 1985 and 2015, I examine the relation between firm's payout policy behavior under changes economic policy uncertainties, both total and individual components of payouts; dividends and open market share repurchases. Using the EPU index and its components developed by Baker et al. (2016), I find payout programs tend to respond differently depending on which component of the uncertainty changes. A persistent negative relationship exists between the level of uncertainty in government spending (GSU) and firms' average level of dividends, share repurchase, and total payout.
