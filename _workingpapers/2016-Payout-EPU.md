Using a sample of all public firms in the U.S. between years 1985 and 2015, I examine the relation between firm behavior in payout policies under changes in the level of economic policy uncertainties, both total and individual components of payouts; dividends and open market share repurchases. Using the EPU index and its components developed by Baker et al. (2016), I find payout programs tend to behave differently depending on which component of the uncertainty rises. A persistent negative relationship exists between the level of uncertainty in government spending (GSU) and a firmâ€™s average level of total payout, dividend amount, and share repurchase amount.
