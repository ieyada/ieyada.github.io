Firms with more risk shifting problems due to the high-risk exposure concentration are likely to include more short-term debt in their capital structures and less covenants in their outstanding bonds. Using a firmâ€™s risk exposure concentration derived from the written text in 10-K filings, we find this effect is more pronounced among companies with strong managerial incentive alignment with shareholders. The findings suggest maintaining future investment flexibility is important for firms with high-risk exposure concentration, even at the expense of a higher liquidity risk associated with the use of short-term debt.
